* Introduction

  The code in this repo concerns the EDT software used in many schools
  to create and manage the class schedule (teachers, classes,
  subjects, lessons, etc.).

  EDT exports its data in various ways and formats, the more useful
  one being a full export of all lessons in CSV format and UTF-16 (!)
  enconding.

  From that data you can extract, process, format and output a lot of
  other "tables" like the full timetable (one row for each teacher,
  one column for each hour, with the class code in each cell) ot the
  class timetable (one column per day, one row per hour and subject
  and teacher info in each cell) and so on.
